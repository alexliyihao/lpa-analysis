 - *visualization_freqs.ipynb* provided sample code and ipynb file generating a intermediate output for R visualization

 - *sessionInfo.txt* described the R environment for visualization
 - *Manuscript_Visualizations.Rmd* provided the code for all the figures, the data source will be noted in the file.

I'm sorry for running them in both R and Python, but the Python is run on the server and R visualization is on my laptop.
