# Visualizations

 - *visualization_freqs.ipynb* provided sample code and ipynb file generating a intermediate output for R visualization
 - *sessionInfo.txt* described the R environment for visualization
 - *Manuscript_Visualizations.Rmd* provided the code for all the figures, the data source will be noted in the file.

Sorry for increasing the complexity by working in both R and Python.
